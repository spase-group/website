        <Description>The Thermal Noise Receiver (TNR) on the WIND
            spacecraft is an instrument of a new generation, which is
            flown for the first time. It utilizes a digital spectrum
            analysis technique similar to a wavelet transform analysis.
            This permits a high time resolution, associated to a high
            frequency resolution. It was essentially designed to measure
            the thermal noise at a high rate. The interest of this
            receiver also covers other events, both in situ (plasma
            waves, ion acoustic waves) and remotely detected (solar and
            magnetospheric radio bursts). However, this receiver uses a
            compression technique which limits the study of high
            intensity events. Namely, the digital dynamic range is about
            45 dB, added to an AGC range of more than 60 dB, the AGC
            acting as a sensitivity adjustment. (e.g. an 80 dB event
            will not saturate the receiver, but the computed spectrum
            will only cover its upper 45 dB.)</Description>
